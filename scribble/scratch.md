# Cast (Hall of fame?)


### Bob Polin


### Peter Adams


### Mystery boss
  All we have seen so far is a plane shadow. Appears when you least expect it. What aircraft is this elusive villain piloting?


Why Blue Max? Why now?
So.
In conclusion the answer must be why not?


## Lessons learned
Everything should be scriptable. For so many reasons. I did not mention this among the project goals, it's just something I take for granted with any project.
I was a bit shocked to find there is no easy way to automate builds with Unity. It's point-and-click. That would be OK for a toy, not for a serious development environment.
There is a service named "Unity Build Automation" provided by Unity. This a managed service. An attempt to lock Unity game developers into Unity's own eco system. Using any other kind of automation seems discouraged.
Who wants "Unity Version Control"? Not me. There appears to be a free plan for Unity Devops, but I'm still not interested.

Since collision detection in a 3D level obviously require objects to overlap in all 3 dimensions, we can not take the same liberties in 3D as the 2D scene.
