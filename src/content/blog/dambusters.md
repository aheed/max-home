# Dam busters mission
**New level!**

You are equipped with bombs designed to bounce on water when dropped from the right altitude.
If the bomb sinks right next to the dam wall it will detonate under water and destroy the dam.
No Bothans died to bring you this information.

You and your bouncing bombs must dodge nets and power lines.
To your aid, or maybe just distraction, you have altitude indicator spotlights mounted on your plane: one under the nose, one under the tail, both pointing down at an exact angle. When the two beams converge on the water surface you are at the correct altitude. That's the theory anyway. Or you could rely on a lucky bounce.

## Status
This level is still under construction.

## Real life mission
Inspired by the famous real life WWII [Dambusters Raid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Chastise).

### In popular culture
The 1955 movie [The Dam Busters](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046889/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) was based on the true story.
Why have you not seen a rerun of this classic movie on TV? Probably because some of its content is **not** acceptable by today's standard.

## Tech
This level implementation relies on Unity's physics system (PhysX).
