## The hero

Oh yes, there is a backstory. From the original game manual:

*\"You are Max Chatsworth. Known by your mates as 'The Blue Max' you
wear the very name of the medal given by the Axis powers to shoot
down your plane!  Now, you must earn the title.  To be successful
you  must  make a final assault on three specially marked targets
within the city.  You have only one aircraft and very little time
to accomplish this most difficult of missions.\"*
