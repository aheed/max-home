### The original isometric villain.

This is the enemy boss robot from the eponymously titled 1981 arcade game. Blue Max was never forgiven for the axonometric perspective ripoff. Zaxxon finally had its rocket launchers repaired (both of them, including the one that never worked even in the 80s). Thusly rearmed, Zaxxon is now returning from its 2.5-dimensional realm for isometric vengeance. And it's packing a seemingly endless supply of missiles.
